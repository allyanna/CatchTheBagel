# CatchTheBagel
How does this Catch the Bagel game work??

A player has the ability to choose between four player options, move from left to right to collect bagels, point boosters, life boosters, as well as items that are deemed detrimental to the player.

The game has 10 levels, for every increasing level, the bagels fall increasingly faster and the amount of points earned increases.

Additionally, all bagels must be caught in order to maintain the amount of lives you start with. Otherwise, your lives get increasingly lower until the game is over.
